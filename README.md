<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
PantryStock is a fullstack application that assists users with managing the ingredients in their kitchen, making shopping lists, and reducing their food waste. 
I made this application both as a learning experience and to create something I could personally use to take control of my pantry.

### Tech Stack

- Postgres[]()
- Python[]()
- Flask[]()
- React[]()
- Redux[]()

<!-- ## Application Architecture Overview -->
<!-- CHART GOES HERE -->
## Frontend Technologies

### React
PantryStock is a React heavy application. The application makes heavy use of React's component tree and virtualDOM features to update components without page refreshes. The app was conceived to be equally usable on mobile devices and desktops. Using React's virtualDOM, only the elements that have changed need to be re-rendered, saving mobile user's bandwidth, and most importantly, their time. 
### Redux
PantryStock relies on the redux library for app-wide state management.
